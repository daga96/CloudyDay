Domestic Violence Victim Support App

### Key Functions:

### **Home Screen (Logout)**

- **Weather Interface**: The app's home screen resembles a typical weather app, displaying the current date, weather conditions, and location-based weather updates.
- **Emergency Button**: A "Report Unusual Weather" button functions as an emergency alert. When activated, it sends an email with vital information to an emergency contact, allowing the victim to signal for help.

### **Home Screen (Login)**

- **Main Menu**: Upon logging in, users are presented with a menu containing several options designed to support victims of domestic violence:
    1. **Assess Danger**: This AI-powered tool evaluates the current situation based on user input, offering a danger assessment to help users understand the severity of their circumstances and decide on appropriate actions.
    2. **Create a Safe Plan**: A short survey is provided to allow users to create a safety plan based on their specific situation. 
    3. **Community**: A space for women to share their experiences and ask for advice. This community forum allows victims to connect with others who have faced similar challenges, fostering support and solidarity.
       
### Google Tools used in the project:

- Google Gemini: used to analyse user text / tag input and assess danger situation of the victim.
